The `FindMultiples` class is an implementation of a multithreaded program that finds all the integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 and returns the sum of all unique integers. The program creates as many threads as required to solve the problem.
The program defines an inner class `find` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The `find` class takes two parameters, `dev` and `n`. `dev` represents the divisor, which can be 3, 5, or 7. `n` represents the maximum number of the range. The `find` class also defines a static variable `sum` and a static hash set `added`. The `sum` variable stores the sum of all unique integers, and the `added` hash set stores all the unique integers that have been added to the sum.
The `find` class also implements a `check` method, which checks if the integer has already been added to the `added` hash set. If the integer has not been added, it adds the integer to the `added` hash set and updates the `sum` variable.
The `getSum` method is the main method that creates three threads for each divisor, 3, 5, and 7, and passes the divisor and the maximum number of the range to the `find` class constructor. It then starts the threads and waits for them to finish by calling the `join` method. Finally, it returns the value of the `sum` variable.
Overall, the program creates three threads that run concurrently and find all the integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7. The program uses a hash set to ensure that only unique integers are added to the `sum` variable. The program then returns the sum of all unique integers found by the threads. The program is efficient and uses multithreading to speed up the process of finding the numbers.
