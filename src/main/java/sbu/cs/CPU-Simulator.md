This code simulates a single-core CPU, which is responsible for executing a list of tasks provided as input. Each task has a specific processing time, which represents the time required to fully execute the task. The CPU chooses the next task to execute based on the shortest processing time first scheduling algorithm and creates a new thread for that task.
The class `Task` represents each task, with two fields: the task's processing time and a unique ID. The `Runnable` interface is implemented in the `Task` class, with the `run()` method simulating the task execution by putting the current thread to sleep for the duration of the task's processing time.
The `CPU_Simulator` class contains the `startSimulation()` method, which receives an ArrayList of `Task` objects as input and returns an ArrayList of strings containing the IDs of the tasks that were executed. The method starts by creating a new ArrayList of `Pair` objects that combines the processing time and the task object. This list is sorted based on the processing time using a comparator. Then, the code loops through each pair, creates a new thread for the corresponding task, and waits for the thread to finish executing by calling `join()`. Once the task has finished executing, the task ID is added to the `executedTasks` list.
Overall, the code is well-organized and easy to follow. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved. Firstly, the sleep time for the `Task` execution is hardcoded to 300 milliseconds, which may not be appropriate for all tasks. It would be better to pass the processing time as an argument to the `sleep()` method. Secondly, the code could be optimized by starting a new thread for the next task while the previous task is still executing, rather than waiting for each task to complete before starting the next one. Finally, there are no unit tests provided, which could help to verify the correctness of the code and catch any potential bugs or edge cases.
